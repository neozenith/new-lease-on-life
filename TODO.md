## Features and Bugs


### Rental and Sales Data

Leverage as many create-helper-scripts subagents as need be.

Create a new python script under `scripts/` that will extract the data out of `data/originals/rental/*.xslx` and `data/originals/sales/*.xslx` and save the results into their respective folders under `data/originals_converted/`.
These excel files contain the median renta

I want all the data consolidated into one file in csv in tall format (not wide format), where there is a column for:

- `value` is a floating point value for the respective median value we are extracting
- `count` if it is available is the associated count of records used to determine the median for that time_bucket
- the `time_bucket` eg formatted like YYYY, YYYY-QQ, YYYY-MM
- `value_type` this is either `sales` or `rent`
- the dwelling type (House, Unit, Vacant Land, Flat). This might be in the file name or the name of the excel worksheets.
- the number of bedrooms. This might be in the file name or the name of the excel worksheets. IMPORTANT make sure you find these values.
- `geospatial_type` - this should be `SUBURB` or `LGA` or `POSTCODE`.  
- the `geospatial_id` eg this could be a postcode, suburb name or an LGA.  
  - Look under `data/originals_converted/boundaries/LGA_2024_AUST_GDA2020/` for LGA data
  - Look under `data/originals_converted/boundaries/SA2_2021_AUST_SHP_GDA2020/` for Suburb data
  - Look under `data/originals_converted/boundaries/POA_2021_AUST_GDA2020_SHP/` for Postcode data
  - Leverage `geopandas` (and `pyarrow`) to explore the geojson or geoparquet (extension `.parquet`) to cross check and validate the suburb and LGA from the excel.

IMPORTANT ALL `value`s from all excel files should be extracted into this one CSV or split into a `consolidated_sales.csv` and `consolidated_rentals.csv` if need be.

Once this CSV file is created create a GeoJSON file where every record gets their corresponding polygon.

Ensure the output files are valid CSV and GeoJSON.

### Animate Deck.GL

- Animate the Deck.GL visualisation with the historical rental and sales data

### Paired Visualisations

- Add a paired visualisation of a line chart showing the rental and sales data over time highlighting  
    current timebucket shown in the Deck.gl component
- All cross filtering by selecting a geoshape or a line in the line chart to filter the underlying data.

### javascript load geoparquet

load geoparquet via duckdb
migrate all geojson static assets to geoparquet
